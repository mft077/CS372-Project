# New Normal
### General Information
A simple game, to succeed in this game the Nurse has to finish collecting the masks and has to bring the patient to his designated room.
This is a Covid - 19 related game so the catch is that while the Nurse is doing his/her task collecting masks and directing
patient to his room, the nurse also needs to avoid the Covid viruses scattered in the hospital or the nurse will decrease health.

Once the nurse's health reached zero, there would be a quiz that need atleast 2 correct answer to come back to the game. There will be 
only 2 chances to succeed
