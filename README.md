# New Normal
### General Information
A simple game where the Nurse has to finish collecting the masks and has to bring the patient to his designated room.
This is a Covid - 19 related game so the catch is that while the Nurse is doing his/her task collecting masks and directing
patient to his room, the nurse also needs to avoid the viruses scattered in the hospital or the nurse will decrease health
